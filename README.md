# CSC110-Project
Culminating group project for the course CSC110: Foundations of Computer Science I. We created a Tweet classifier that could identify emotions in tweets related to COVID-19.

We applied the Computer Science concepts we had learned throughout the year, and used the Tweepy APIs as well as Sci-Kit Learn.
